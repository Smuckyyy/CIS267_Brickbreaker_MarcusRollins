Description
-----------------------
This game is my version of the classic game Breakout on the Atari. My version features the staple gameplay of the classic; a paddle, a ball, and the bricks. I have made bricks randomly drop powerups throughout the gameplay, and the game features 2 different
setups of bricks that the level can appear as. Use the arrow keys and the space bar to shoot the ball. If the ball goes underneath the paddle 3 times, its game over.

There are two types of Bricks:
-1 hit bricks
-2 hit bricks

There are 3 types of "powerups":
-Bonus Points for Score
-Speed the ball up
-Make the paddle bigger

-----------------------
Problems
-----------------------
Getting the powerups to randomly spawn and the two level setups were a bit confusing at first since theres multiple ways I could've done them both, but I realized there were easier ways to do it once I started messing around with the game more
and the brick placements. Also, changing the aspect ratio of the game to have it match what I had in Unity I did not know how to do, so I had to shrink the game down to match WebGL (which is extremely annoying). Other than that, I didn't have any other issues.
